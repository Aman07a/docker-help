To make your Docker image publicly accessible or grant access to specific users, you can use the Docker Hub repository settings.

1. Log in to Docker Hub and navigate to the repository page that you want to share.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab at the top of the page.
3. Under the "Visibility" section, select "Public" if you want to make the Docker image publicly accessible, or "Private" if you want to grant access to specific users.
4. If you selected "Private", you can grant access to specific users by entering their Docker Hub usernames or email addresses in the "Access Settings" section.
5. Click the "Save Changes" button to update the repository settings.
If you made your Docker image publicly accessible, anyone can pull the image using the `docker pull` command with the repository name, like `docker pull aman07a/myapp`.

If you granted access to specific users, they will need to log in to Docker Hub using the `docker login` command with their own Docker Hub credentials before they can pull the image.

Note that you can also control access to your Docker images using organization memberships or teams on Docker Hub. This can be useful for managing access to images within a larger group or organization.
